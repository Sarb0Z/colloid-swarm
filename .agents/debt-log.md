# Debt log

Standing tradeoffs and deferred *decisions* — the "naive O(n³) here, fine until
N>10k, rework needs a spatial index" record. Committed, and pulled on demand when
you touch the code that carries the pointer. Not auto-surfaced; its sibling
`breadcrumbs.md` is the actionable queue, this is the reference.

Reference an entry from code as `debt: <id>` — the pointer goes inline, never the
reasoning. One `### <id>` heading per entry (a kebab slug, e.g.
`colloid-07-naive-scan`), with one line each for:

- **Condition** — what the code does now, and why it's acceptable today.
- **Trigger** — the observation that would justify paying it off.
- **Rework** — what the fix costs.
